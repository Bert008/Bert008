Hi, I'm Bert. I'm a phisics student about to get graduate from university (UAEMex).
In my road to beceome a scientist i got intrested for the phisics and the computer science, 
thats why i know how to use a computer to make computing and use it to solve some problems.
Few years ago a got very intested to work with computers, becouse of COVID, in that way i heard about Machine learning and Data Scientist.
Machine Learnig has a lot of uses and its very usefull the use of statistics and the coding.
Even i learned to use other programing language, i tried to leran more about Python, Pandas and how to mixing them with Mathematics.
I know how to code and i'm trying to do it better, that why i want to become an intern or apprentices after to take the role
of Data Scientist.
