Hi, I'm Bert. I'm a physics student about to graduate from university (UAEMex). On my road to becoming a scientist, I became interested in physics and computer science. That's why I learned how to use a computer for computing and solving problems. A few years ago, I became very interested in working with computers because of COVID. In that way, I heard about Machine Learning and Data Analysis. Machine Learning has many applications, and it is very useful in combining statistics and coding. I learned to use various programming languages and focused on learning more about Python, Pandas, and how to integrate them with mathematics. I know how to code, and I'm striving to improve my skills. That's why I want to become an intern or apprentice and eventually take on the role of a Data Scientist.
